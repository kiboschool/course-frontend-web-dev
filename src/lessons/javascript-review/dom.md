# Document Object Model (DOM)

Welcome to our exploration of the DOM! Now, as we dive deeper into web development, it's crucial to understand what the DOM is and how we interact with it.

First, we'll discuss the concept of the DOM itself, giving you a clear picture of its role in web pages. Next, we'll delve into the different types of nodes or elements that make up the DOM.

Once we have a foundational understanding, we'll move into more hands-on topics: how to select specific elements, how to update them to display new content or styles, and methods to add or remove elements on the page.

By the end of this section, through exercises and examples, you'll gain practical experience manipulating the DOM and enhancing user interaction on web pages. We'll finish with some questions to consolidate your learning. Get ready for a fun dive into one of the core aspects of web interactivity!
