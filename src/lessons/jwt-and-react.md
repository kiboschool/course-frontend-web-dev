# JWT, Auth React

## Introduction to Week 8: JWT and React

Welcome to Week 8,  we'll start by discussing the concept of authentication flows and how they work in a modern web application. We'll then specifically focus on JWT, exploring what it is, how it works, and why it's beneficial for managing user sessions in web applications.

We'll examine the idea of protected routes in a React application and see how we can implement these using JWT for user authentication. We'll also look at how JWT integrates with React, especially in terms of storing and transmitting tokens.

The week culminates in a hands-on exercise that allows you to put into practice the concepts you've learned, followed by a project where you'll implement JWT authentication and protected routes in a React application.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

* Understand what an authentication flow is and why it's needed in web applications
* Understand what JWT is and how it's used for authentication and session management
* Implement protected routes in a React application using JWT
* Integrate JWT with a React application, including token storage and transmission
