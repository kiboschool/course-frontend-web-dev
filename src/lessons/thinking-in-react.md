# Thinking in React

**Welcome to Week 5: Thinking in React**

Welcome to Week 5, where we will continue to build on our React knowledge and learn how to think in React. Thinking in React is an essential skill to master as it sets the foundation for how we structure our applications and how we manage data flow.

This week, we will compare class components with functional components and understand the pros and cons of each. We'll dive into the concepts of props and state, two fundamental aspects of React that handle data and determine how our components render and behave.

Next, we'll introduce the useState and useEffect hooks. These hooks allow us to manage state and side effects in our functional components. We'll also discuss how to render lists in React, an essential tool for displaying arrays of data on the front end.

By the end of the week, we will introduce the concept of React Hooks. These are a powerful feature of React that allows us to use state and other React features without having to write a class. Finally, you will get a chance to apply all your knowledge in a project.
