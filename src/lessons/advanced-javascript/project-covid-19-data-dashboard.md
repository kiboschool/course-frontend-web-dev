# Project: Covid-19 Data Dashboard

## 0. Project Set-up

Get your starter code and project set up [here](https://github.com/kiboschool/frontend-week-3-final-project)

## 1. Project Summary

In this project, you will build an interactive data dashboard that provides meaningful insights into the COVID-19 pandemic based on given data. The dashboard will display data related to cases, deaths, and recoveries, and allow users to filter and sort this data by country or date.

## 2. Learning Objectives

This project aims to practice your skills in:

- JavaScript ES6 array methods (map, filter, sort, forEach, reduce, etc.)
- Data manipulation and presentation
- Creating responsive and interactive UIs using CSS Flexbox

## 3. Project Description

The COVID-19 data dashboard will consist of the following features:

- **Display Total Statistics:** Show the total cases, deaths, and recoveries for a specific set of countries.
- **Filter by Country:** Allow users to type a country name in an input field to view its data.
- **Filter by Date:** Allow users to select a month or a year to view data specific to that period.
- **Sort by Cases, Deaths, Recoveries:** Allow users to sort the data based on the number of cases, deaths, or recoveries.

Your aim is not only to write functional code but also to create a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard. Be creative!

## 4. Milestones

### Milestone 1: Display Total Statistics

- Display stats on your dashboard for 20 provided countries.

### Milestone 2: Implement Country Filter

- Add an input field to allow users to type the name of a country. Make sure to handle cases where users type in lowercase, uppercase, or a combination of both.
- Display data for the selected country when a valid name is entered.

### Milestone 3: Implement Date Filter

- Add buttons or a dropdown menu to allow users to select a month or a year.
- Display data for the selected period when a valid date is chosen.

### Milestone 4: Implement Sorting

- Add clickable table headers that allow users to sort countries based on the number of cases, deaths, or recoveries.

### Milestone 5: Bonus

- Use a library like D3.js to implement more graphs that use the same data. Maybe a bar or pie graph. Show off your skills.

## 5. Workspace Setup and Resources

We'll provide the JSON data, which includes information about the COVID-19 pandemic for 20 countries over 12 months.

## 6. Delivery

- The project should be pushed to your GitHub repository: include all code files, a screenshot of your dashboard, and a README that includes an overview of your project, challenges you faced, solutions you found, and what you learned during the project.
