# Assessments

Your overall course grade is made up of:

- Weeks 1 and 3 Practice Exercises: 10% (5% each)
- Weekly Assignments: 64% (8% each)
- Final Project: 26%

## Practice Exercises

Throughout the course, there are practice exercises that are recommended each week.  We will not
be asking you to submit evidence of completing all of these practice exercises, but we will ask for you to
submit some.  Just because we ask that you submit some exercises but not others, this is not an indication
of their relative importance.  You should strive to do as much practice as possible.  As with anything,
practice is how you develop mastery.

## Weekly Assignments

Each week you will be given an assignment, where you'll practice the concepts
covered in the readings and lessons.  The assignment let you practice the topics you covered that week, explore applications and connections, and check your own understanding of the material.

Assignments will be distributed via GitHub classroom, and you will be asked to write significant code.  Upon
completion of the assignments, they will be submitted to Gradescope for grading.

## Final Project

You will have a final project in this course.  Projects are larger in scale and will
give you an opportunity to work with larger amounts of code to solve more complex problems.  You will be given two weeks to complete the project.  This project represent a significant portion of your grade, and so it is important that you start it as early as possible.
