# Course Overview

I welcome you to this new adventure of learning Front End  Web Development.

Over the next 10 weeks, we will embark on an adventure of understanding JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. We will learn industry-standard frameworks for building Front End systems.  

We will discover the main use cases, best practices, and techniques that will allow us to create beautiful, fast, and functional UIs (User Interfaces) for any web application.
