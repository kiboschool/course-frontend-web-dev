# Conditionals

As a Python developer, you're already familiar with conditional statements â€“ blocks of code that run based on whether certain conditions are true or false. The concept in JavaScript remains the same, but with a few key differences that we'll discuss in this article.

## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement in JavaScript functions similarly to Python. Here's a side-by-side comparison:

**Python:**

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

**JavaScript:**

```jsx
let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
}
```

The syntax in JavaScript requires parentheses around the condition, unlike Python. Also, you'll notice that JavaScript uses curly braces `{}` to denote the block of code associated with the condition, and the line ends with a semicolon.

## `else` and `else if`

Just like Python, JavaScript has `else` and `else if` clauses. These work very similarly to their Python counterparts.

**Python:**

```python
x = 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is exactly 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")
```

**JavaScript:**

```jsx
let x = 10;
if (x > 10) {
    console.log("x is greater than 10");
} else if (x === 10) {
    console.log("x is exactly 10");
} else {
    console.log("x is less than 10");
}

```

Note that `elif` in Python is equivalent to `else if` in JavaScript. Also, `==` in JavaScript performs type coercion and checks for equality of value, but not type. The `===` operator checks for equality of both value and type.

## Switch Case

JavaScript has a `switch` statement, which is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Python doesn't have a built-in switch case statement, and it is often simulated using if..elif..else chains or dictionaries.

Here's a simple example of a `switch` statement in JavaScript:

```jsx
let fruit = "Apple";

switch(fruit) {
    case "Apple":
        console.log("Red");
        break;
    case "Banana":
        console.log("Yellow");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Unknown fruit");
}
```

The `switch` statement evaluates an expression and checks it against different `case` values. If there's a match, the corresponding block of code is executed. The `break` keyword is used to exit the switch case. Without it, the program will continue to the next case, causing potentially unwanted behavior. The `default` keyword specifies code to run if there's no match.

## Truthy and Falsy Values

In JavaScript, all values have an inherent boolean truthiness or falsiness. This differs from Python, which has a specific set of rules for what evaluates to `True` or `False`.

In JavaScript, the falsy values are `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`. Everything else is truthy.

This is important to understand because it impacts how conditions are evaluated in JavaScript. For example:

```jsx
let name = "";
if (name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
} else {
    console.log("No name provided");
}
```

In this example, if **`name`** is an empty string, the message "No name provided" will be logged to the console.

## **Ternary Operator**

JavaScript, like Python, has a ternary operator for handling simple conditional logic in a concise way. Here's a comparison:

**Python:**

```python
x = 10
message = "x is 10" if x == 10 else "x is not 10"
```

**JavaScript:**

```jsx
let x = 10;
let message = x === 10 ? "x is 10" : "x is not 10";
```

The syntax is slightly different, but the concept is the same: evaluate a condition and return one value if it's true, and another value if it's false.
