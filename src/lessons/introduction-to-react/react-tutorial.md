# React Tutorial

The React dev team publishes extensive documentation about the framework.

The documentation is split into two parts: _Learn React_ and the _React Reference_. Learn React introduces and explains how to use the framework. The React Reference has detailed API documentation, detailing how each feature works in depth.

Read the Quick Start and Tic-tac-toe tutorial for a jumping-off point to React, in the words of the development team themselves.
