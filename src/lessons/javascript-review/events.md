# Events

Let's switch gears and dive into another vital aspect of web development: browser events. Events are the bread and butter of interactivity on the web. They allow users to interact with web pages through actions like clicking, typing, dragging, and many more.

In this section, we'll kick things off by understanding what an event is in the context of web development. Then, we'll explore the variety of events available to us--believe me, there's an event for almost everything!

By the end of this module, you'll be well-equipped to make your web pages come alive with user interactions. Let's dive in!
