# Introduction to React

Alright, let's dive deeper into React!

First, we'll discuss what React actually is. Why is it everywhere and what's the big deal about it?

Once we understand that, we'll get our hands dirty. We're going to set up our very first React project.

With our project ready, we'll create our first component. Think of components like building blocks for our app.

Next, we'll touch on JSX. It might look like a mix of HTML and JavaScript, and well, it kind of is! We'll see how it works with React.

Of course, we want our apps to look good, so we'll explore how we can use CSS with React. 

React is also all about interaction. We'll find out how React deals with events like button clicks or form submissions.

Lastly, we'll have a peek at the component lifecycle. It's about understanding how a React component is born, grows, and is deleted.

Let's jump in and learn together!
